Note:

The provided flight data is generated from an older version of the MATLAB script. To use this flight data with the current non-linear simulation frame work, you must do the following conversion immediately after you have loaded your flightdata, e.g.:

FlightData = FlightDataAircraft5;
FlightData.Geometric = FlightData.Geo;
FlightData.Inertial = FlightData.I;
FlightData.Propeller = FlightData.Prop;
